### Tips
Try experimenting with the comaprison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` aand `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting, their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, avalableTime) {
    console.log("hungry is", hungry);
    console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
